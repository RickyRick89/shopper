# my thoughts
These are my thoughts on how it works so far:
* Not good!
* I just want to be able to run the front end. It should start the backend if needed.
* The search doesn't seem to work at all. The scraping isn't really happening.
* Everytime I search. It should scrape for the latest info online for the product. The info should be saved.
* None of the advanced features really work (wishlist, login etc...)
